# Can_Hilliard_PDE


The code provided implements a simple Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model. This model is used to simulate the evolution of a scalar field (order parameter) called Phi, which represents the concentration field in this case. The model is based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which describes phase separation phenomena.

Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model

## Overview:
------------
This code implements a simple Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model. The model simulates the evolution of a scalar field (order parameter) called Phi, which represents the concentration field. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is used to describe phase separation phenomena.

## Requirements:
